00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
that objectives and measurable metrics
 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.330 align:start position:0%
that objectives and measurable metrics
are<00:05:23.820><c> the</c><00:05:24.000><c> only</c><00:05:24.180><c> route</c><00:05:24.479><c> to</c><00:05:24.720><c> achievement</c>

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
are the only route to achievement
 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.189 align:start position:0%
are the only route to achievement
so<00:05:27.060><c> let's</c><00:05:27.180><c> take</c><00:05:27.419><c> a</c><00:05:27.539><c> closer</c><00:05:27.780><c> look</c><00:05:27.900><c> at</c><00:05:28.080><c> the</c>

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
so let's take a closer look at the
 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.110 align:start position:0%
so let's take a closer look at the
arguments<00:05:28.620><c> Kenneth</c><00:05:29.160><c> and</c><00:05:29.340><c> job</c><00:05:29.520><c> make</c><00:05:29.820><c> against</c>

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
arguments Kenneth and job make against
 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.689 align:start position:0%
arguments Kenneth and job make against
objectives<00:05:31.199><c> beginning</c><00:05:31.680><c> with</c><00:05:32.160><c> the</c><00:05:32.400><c> argument</c>

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
objectives beginning with the argument
 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.969 align:start position:0%
objectives beginning with the argument
that<00:05:33.060><c> goals</c><00:05:33.539><c> kill</c><00:05:33.780><c> rather</c><00:05:34.440><c> than</c><00:05:34.620><c> create</c>

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
that goals kill rather than create
 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
that goals kill rather than create
opportunity

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.110 align:start position:0%
opportunity
so<00:05:37.080><c> to</c><00:05:37.259><c> illustrate</c><00:05:37.620><c> this</c><00:05:37.860><c> point</c><00:05:38.100><c> I've</c><00:05:38.639><c> created</c>

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
so to illustrate this point I've created
 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.529 align:start position:0%
so to illustrate this point I've created
a<00:05:39.539><c> simple</c><00:05:39.660><c> interactive</c><00:05:40.440><c> visualization</c>

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 align:start position:0%
a simple interactive visualization
 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.990 align:start position:0%
a simple interactive visualization
so<00:05:42.900><c> if</c><00:05:43.139><c> you</c><00:05:43.199><c> imagine</c><00:05:43.380><c> yourself</c><00:05:43.740><c> as</c><00:05:44.520><c> this</c><00:05:44.820><c> B</c>

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
so if you imagine yourself as this B
 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.090 align:start position:0%
so if you imagine yourself as this B
over<00:05:45.360><c> here</c><00:05:45.600><c> and</c><00:05:46.500><c> you</c><00:05:46.620><c> imagine</c><00:05:46.800><c> yourself</c>

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
over here and you imagine yourself
 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.070 align:start position:0%
over here and you imagine yourself

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
for flowers with nectar on them then
 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
for flowers with nectar on them then
let's<00:05:52.740><c> assume</c><00:05:53.220><c> that</c><00:05:53.400><c> the</c><00:05:53.580><c> B</c><00:05:53.759><c> follows</c><00:05:54.360><c> the</c>

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
let's assume that the B follows the
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.409 align:start position:0%
let's assume that the B follows the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.150 align:start position:0%
flower it wants to fly to Let's imagine
it<00:06:02.880><c> sets</c><00:06:03.180><c> it</c><00:06:03.300><c> to</c><00:06:03.419><c> this</c><00:06:03.660><c> one</c><00:06:03.780><c> over</c><00:06:04.020><c> here</c><00:06:04.199><c> then</c><00:06:05.039><c> it</c>

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
it sets it to this one over here then it
 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.430 align:start position:0%
it sets it to this one over here then it
also<00:06:05.400><c> decides</c><00:06:05.820><c> to</c><00:06:06.000><c> use</c><00:06:06.180><c> the</c><00:06:06.539><c> distance</c><00:06:06.780><c> towards</c>

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
also decides to use the distance towards
 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.189 align:start position:0%
also decides to use the distance towards
that<00:06:07.680><c> flower</c><00:06:07.860><c> as</c><00:06:08.460><c> its</c><00:06:08.759><c> metric</c><00:06:09.060><c> as</c><00:06:09.900><c> its</c>

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
that flower as its metric as its
 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.810 align:start position:0%
that flower as its metric as its
distance<00:06:10.320><c> decreases</c><00:06:10.979><c> it</c><00:06:11.340><c> knows</c><00:06:11.580><c> it's</c><00:06:11.699><c> going</c>

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
distance decreases it knows it's going
 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.490 align:start position:0%
distance decreases it knows it's going
in<00:06:12.000><c> the</c><00:06:12.180><c> right</c><00:06:12.300><c> direction</c><00:06:12.479><c> and</c><00:06:13.139><c> if</c><00:06:13.320><c> the</c>

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
in the right direction and if the
 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.170 align:start position:0%
in the right direction and if the
distance<00:06:13.680><c> towards</c><00:06:14.160><c> that</c><00:06:14.340><c> flower</c><00:06:14.520><c> increases</c>

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
distance towards that flower increases
 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.430 align:start position:0%
distance towards that flower increases
then<00:06:15.360><c> it</c><00:06:15.539><c> knows</c><00:06:15.780><c> it's</c><00:06:15.840><c> going</c><00:06:16.020><c> in</c><00:06:16.199><c> the</c><00:06:16.320><c> wrong</c>

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
then it knows it's going in the wrong
 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.330 align:start position:0%
then it knows it's going in the wrong
direction

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
direction
 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.430 align:start position:0%
direction
so<00:06:17.759><c> let's</c><00:06:17.940><c> see</c><00:06:18.120><c> what</c><00:06:18.240><c> that</c><00:06:18.360><c> would</c><00:06:18.539><c> look</c><00:06:18.660><c> like</c>

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
so let's see what that would look like
 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.010 align:start position:0%
so let's see what that would look like
the<00:06:19.860><c> b</c><00:06:20.039><c> word</c><00:06:20.220><c> go</c><00:06:20.759><c> along</c><00:06:20.940><c> here</c>

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
the b word go along here
 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.570 align:start position:0%
the b word go along here
go<00:06:22.440><c> up</c><00:06:22.620><c> here</c>

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
go up here
 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.370 align:start position:0%
go up here
I<00:06:23.940><c> would</c><00:06:24.060><c> realize</c><00:06:24.360><c> that</c><00:06:24.539><c> going</c><00:06:24.720><c> down</c><00:06:24.960><c> here</c><00:06:25.199><c> is</c>

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
I would realize that going down here is
 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.590 align:start position:0%
I would realize that going down here is
the<00:06:25.560><c> wrong</c><00:06:25.680><c> way</c><00:06:25.860><c> sort</c><00:06:26.220><c> of</c><00:06:26.340><c> go</c><00:06:26.460><c> back</c><00:06:26.639><c> down</c><00:06:27.300><c> here</c>

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
the wrong way sort of go back down here
 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.390 align:start position:0%
the wrong way sort of go back down here
around<00:06:28.080><c> here</c>

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
around here
 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.850 align:start position:0%
around here
do<00:06:29.699><c> do</c>

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.010 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:06:32.340><c> gradually</c><00:06:32.759><c> makes</c><00:06:33.000><c> its</c><00:06:33.360><c> way</c>

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
and gradually makes its way
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.230 align:start position:0%
and gradually makes its way
towards<00:06:34.500><c> the</c><00:06:34.680><c> objective</c>

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
towards the objective
 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.029 align:start position:0%
towards the objective
so<00:06:36.539><c> clearly</c><00:06:36.780><c> the</c><00:06:36.960><c> bee's</c><00:06:37.199><c> decision</c><00:06:37.500><c> to</c><00:06:37.680><c> use</c><00:06:37.860><c> an</c>

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
so clearly the bee's decision to use an
 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.670 align:start position:0%
so clearly the bee's decision to use an
objective<00:06:38.400><c> here</c><00:06:38.639><c> has</c><00:06:39.120><c> a</c><00:06:39.240><c> major</c><00:06:39.360><c> drawback</c><00:06:40.319><c> if</c>

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
objective here has a major drawback if
 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.370 align:start position:0%
objective here has a major drawback if
we<00:06:40.800><c> reach</c><00:06:41.160><c> out</c><00:06:41.280><c> the</c><00:06:41.460><c> flight</c><00:06:41.699><c> path</c><00:06:41.940><c> of</c><00:06:42.120><c> a</c><00:06:42.300><c> b</c><00:06:42.419><c> then</c>

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
we reach out the flight path of a b then
 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.950 align:start position:0%
we reach out the flight path of a b then
as<00:06:43.860><c> it</c><00:06:43.979><c> flies</c><00:06:44.280><c> down</c><00:06:44.460><c> here</c><00:06:44.699><c> you</c><00:06:45.419><c> can</c><00:06:45.539><c> see</c><00:06:45.720><c> that</c>

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
as it flies down here you can see that
 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.249 align:start position:0%
as it flies down here you can see that
had<00:06:46.500><c> it</c><00:06:46.680><c> decided</c><00:06:47.160><c> to</c><00:06:47.639><c> fly</c><00:06:48.600><c> into</c><00:06:48.840><c> this</c><00:06:49.080><c> flower</c>

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
had it decided to fly into this flower
 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
had it decided to fly into this flower
and<00:06:49.740><c> explore</c><00:06:50.039><c> this</c><00:06:50.340><c> region</c><00:06:50.639><c> of</c><00:06:50.759><c> the</c>

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
and explore this region of the
 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.550 align:start position:0%
and explore this region of the
