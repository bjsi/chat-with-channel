00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
the stack
 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.470 align:start position:0%
the stack

the order doesn't mean anything so we're
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.990 align:start position:0%
the order doesn't mean anything so we're
really<00:00:36.880><c> truly</c><00:00:37.200><c> going</c><00:00:37.280><c> to</c><00:00:37.360><c> be</c><00:00:37.520><c> trawling</c>

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
really truly going to be trawling
 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.869 align:start position:0%

cream in the dirt um
 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.709 align:start position:0%
cream in the dirt um
so<00:00:46.960><c> i</c><00:00:47.120><c> figured</c><00:00:47.840><c> you</c><00:00:47.920><c> know</c><00:00:48.239><c> while</c><00:00:48.480><c> i'm</c><00:00:48.559><c> doing</c>

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
so i figured you know while i'm doing
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.229 align:start position:0%
so i figured you know while i'm doing
that<00:00:48.879><c> i</c><00:00:49.039><c> might</c><00:00:49.200><c> as</c><00:00:49.280><c> well</c><00:00:49.440><c> turn</c><00:00:49.600><c> this</c><00:00:49.840><c> into</c><00:00:50.079><c> sort</c>

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
that i might as well turn this into sort
 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.270 align:start position:0%
that i might as well turn this into sort
of<00:00:50.480><c> a</c>

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
brainstorm and they
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.390 align:start position:0%
brainstorm and they
also<00:03:34.640><c> send</c><00:03:34.879><c> up</c><00:03:35.040><c> a</c><00:03:35.120><c> signal</c><00:03:35.760><c> then</c><00:03:35.920><c> the</c><00:03:36.080><c> system</c>

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
also send up a signal then the system
 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
also send up a signal then the system

physiological science that you can use
 

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.230 align:start position:0%
physiological science that you can use
to<00:08:41.919><c> measure</c><00:08:42.320><c> interest</c><00:08:42.959><c> in</c><00:08:43.120><c> a</c><00:08:43.200><c> certain</c><00:08:43.519><c> thing</c>

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
to measure interest in a certain thing
 

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
to measure interest in a certain thing

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
really the the um
 

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.190 align:start position:0%
really the the um

the application of this for me would be
 

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.949 align:start position:0%
the application of this for me would be
um

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:56.470 align:start position:0%
um
you<00:08:53.120><c> know</c><00:08:53.600><c> are</c><00:08:53.760><c> you</c><00:08:54.560><c> able</c><00:08:54.880><c> to</c><00:08:55.760><c> record</c><00:08:56.320><c> that</c>

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know are you able to record that
 

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.070 align:start position:0%
you know are you able to record that
sort<00:08:56.640><c> of</c><00:08:56.720><c> data</c><00:08:57.040><c> in</c><00:08:57.120><c> real</c><00:08:57.440><c> time</c><00:08:57.680><c> for</c><00:08:57.760><c> example</c>

and<00:08:59.839><c> maybe</c><00:09:00.720><c> when</c><00:09:00.880><c> you</c><00:09:01.120><c> measure</c><00:09:01.600><c> that</c><00:09:01.760><c> a</c>

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
and maybe when you measure that a
 

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
and maybe when you measure that a

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
um reading this topic and
 

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
um reading this topic and
there's<00:09:11.120><c> some</c><00:09:11.519><c> physiological</c><00:09:12.399><c> signal</c><00:09:12.720><c> that</c>

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's some physiological signal that
 

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.310 align:start position:0%
there's some physiological signal that
gets<00:09:13.120><c> measured</c><00:09:13.440><c> by</c><00:09:13.600><c> the</c><00:09:13.680><c> webcam</c>

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
gets measured by the webcam
 

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
gets measured by the webcam
such<00:09:14.640><c> as</c><00:09:14.720><c> my</c><00:09:14.959><c> eyes</c><00:09:15.600><c> you</c><00:09:15.760><c> know</c><00:09:15.920><c> they</c><00:09:16.160><c> start</c>

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
such as my eyes you know they start
 

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.550 align:start position:0%
such as my eyes you know they start
drifting<00:09:17.040><c> or</c><00:09:17.120><c> something</c><00:09:17.519><c> i</c><00:09:17.680><c> don't</c><00:09:17.839><c> know</c>

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
drifting or something i don't know
 

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.710 align:start position:0%
drifting or something i don't know
um<00:09:19.200><c> maybe</c><00:09:19.519><c> it</c><00:09:19.680><c> automatically</c><00:09:20.240><c> just</c><00:09:20.399><c> skips</c><00:09:20.640><c> to</c>

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe it automatically just skips to
 

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.070 align:start position:0%
um maybe it automatically just skips to
the<00:09:20.800><c> next</c><00:09:20.959><c> topic</c><00:09:21.279><c> for</c><00:09:21.440><c> me</c><00:09:21.680><c> because</c><00:09:21.839><c> it's</c>

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
the next topic for me because it's
 

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.710 align:start position:0%
the next topic for me because it's
measured<00:09:22.399><c> that</c>

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
measured that
 

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.190 align:start position:0%
measured that
my<00:09:22.959><c> interest</c><00:09:23.279><c> was</c><00:09:23.440><c> so</c><00:09:23.920><c> was</c><00:09:24.240><c> was</c><00:09:24.399><c> getting</c><00:09:24.720><c> low</c>

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
my interest was so was was getting low
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
my interest was so was was getting low
like<00:09:25.519><c> i</c><00:09:25.760><c> often</c>

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
like i often
 

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.550 align:start position:0%

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
that right now just to be sure but
 

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
that right now just to be sure but
i<00:15:07.199><c> i</c><00:15:07.360><c> do</c><00:15:07.600><c> recall</c><00:15:09.360><c> um</c>

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
i i do recall um
 

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
i i do recall um

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
reading an article where he basically
 

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:20.710 align:start position:0%

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
right<00:15:20.959><c> yeah</c><00:15:21.600><c> so</c><00:15:21.839><c> i</c><00:15:22.000><c> think</c><00:15:23.279><c> at</c><00:15:23.440><c> least</c>

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
like learning for him it's it's a known
 

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.550 align:start position:0%
