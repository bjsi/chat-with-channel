so essentially the purpose of this
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.830 align:start position:0%
so essentially the purpose of this
presentation<00:00:22.640><c> is</c><00:00:22.960><c> to</c><00:00:23.199><c> ensure</c><00:00:23.519><c> that</c><00:00:23.600><c> this</c>

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
presentation is to ensure that this

presentation is to ensure that this
knowledge<00:00:24.240><c> doesn't</c><00:00:24.480><c> get</c><00:00:24.640><c> lost</c>

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
knowledge doesn't get lost
 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.790 align:start position:0%
knowledge doesn't get lost
because<00:00:25.279><c> the</c><00:00:25.439><c> talk</c><00:00:25.680><c> with</c><00:00:25.760><c> paul</c><00:00:26.000><c> was</c><00:00:26.240><c> excellent</c>

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
because the talk with paul was excellent
 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.910 align:start position:0%
because the talk with paul was excellent
but<00:00:27.039><c> unfortunately</c><00:00:27.519><c> it</c><00:00:27.599><c> couldn't</c><00:00:27.760><c> be</c>

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 align:start position:0%

recorded
 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.750 align:start position:0%
recorded
so<00:00:29.199><c> uh</c><00:00:29.760><c> hopefully</c><00:00:30.400><c> this</c><00:00:30.720><c> will</c><00:00:31.039><c> let</c><00:00:31.279><c> people</c><00:00:31.519><c> who</c>

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
so uh hopefully this will let people who
 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
so uh hopefully this will let people who

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
get some of the insights that those who
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.430 align:start position:0%
get some of the insights that those who
