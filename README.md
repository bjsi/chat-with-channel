## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to Chat with Channel, an open source framework for creating YouTube chatbots with GPT. I've been using it to chat with AI versions of [Brett Hall](https://www.youtube.com/@bretthall9080) who makes videos and podcasts about the works of Karl Popper and David Deutsch, and it's been a lot of fun. If you are curious you can check that out [here](). I hope you find it useful too!

### ‚ú® Features

- **AI-powered Chatbot**: Chat with your favorite youtubers.
